Title: Finite Sample Power Calculations for Detection Boundary Tests
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Ryan", "Sun", email = "ryansun.work@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Calculates lower bound on power, upper bound on power, and exact power (small sets only) for detection boundary tests (e.g. Berk-Jones, Generalized Berk-Jones, innovated Berk-Jones) used in set-based inference studies. These detection boundary tests are described in Sun et al., (2019) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2019.1660170>.
